# CardSetAnalysis
A program to give a rough distribution of the cards in a MTGA set

Each year several MTGA card sets are released. Within each set, there are hundreds of cards with various methods to categorize them.
It is beneficial to understand the makeup of a set to grasp the true value of a card. Like the name of the format I enjoy the most,
my time is "Limited." This program will provide a distribution of the set pertaining to several categories thus, removing the need to
manually evaluate a cardset for a particular field.
